# ucsd-algorithmic-toolbox
My solutions to the programming assignments for the Algorithmic Toolbox course by University of California San Diego.

Part of the Data Structures and Algorithms specialisation found at: 
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms 

All solutions are my own, any similarities found with other solutions are due to the use of course recommended starter files for certain programming exercises.
